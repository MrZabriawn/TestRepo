    <h2 class="about">About Me</h2>
    <p class="about">My name is <b>Zabriawn Smith</b>. I have been a licensed realtor for almost three years. I
        currently
        own two
        rental homes.
        One of them there is a family that already lives there. The other one is a rehab project. I made this website to
        show some of the homes that I have for sale on behalf of my clients. I am asking for $1,250,000 for each home.
        These
        are cash only sales. </p>
